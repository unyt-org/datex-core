# Release Guide

This document describes the process of releasing a new version of the Datex Core library. The process creates a Github release, updates the version number in the Cargo.toml file, and publishes the new version to crates.io.

1. Run the ["Create release"](https://github.com/unyt-org/datex-core/actions/workflows/create-release.yml) workflow in Github. 
 * Specify whether you want to create a new major, minor, or patch release. 
 * The workflow will create a new release branch based on the current main branch, named `release/MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` and also opens a Pull Request to merge the release branch into the main branch. The version number in the Cargo.toml file is also automatically updated to the new version.

2. Create feat, fix, chore, refactor, docs or test branches from the release branch to work on new features, bug fixes, etc.
	* Command to create a new branch:
	```sh
	git fetch && git checkout -b feat/feature-name release/MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
	```
3. Create a Pull Request to merge the branch into the release branch when ready
4. When all features are merged into the release branch, close the Pull Request to merge the release branch into the main branch.
